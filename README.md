Aadhaar Fraud Detection using AI & OCR

This project verifies the authenticity of Aadhaar cards using:

✔ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
✔ Image Preprocessing (OpenCV)
✔ Optical Character Recognition (Tesseract)
✔ Streamlit User Interface

It detects whether an Aadhaar card is Genuine or Tampered and extracts key fields such as:

Name

Date of Birth

Aadhaar Number
